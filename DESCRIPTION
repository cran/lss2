        on Least-Squares Principle

Description: Due to lack of proper inference procedure and software,
        the ordinary linear regression model is seldom used in practice
        for the analysis of right censored data. This paper presents an
        S-Plus/R program that implements a recently developed inference
        procedure (Jin, Lin and Ying, 2006) <doi:10.1093/biomet/93.1.147> 
        for the accelerated failure time model based on the least-squares
        principle.
